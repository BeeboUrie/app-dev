  **Lee Jae-wook as Jang Uk / Winter**

> He's only son of Jang Gang, the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan, Jang Uk, is one of the heirs of four major families. The heirs of four major families are called the “four seasons.” However, Jang Uk is different from the other three. His mother died after giving birth to him, and his father abandoned him. Jang Gang called Jang Uk an illegitimate child and cut off the energy flow that he was born with. Without the energy flow, Jang Uk was just a normal person and didn’t fit into the circle of mages. Yet, his friends Seo Yul and Park Dang Gu never let him feel like an outcast. Jang Uk often felt humiliated, but he was persistent in reopening his energy flow. He trained under every master in Daeho, but no one could open his energy flow because Jang Gang had told everyone not to.

**Jung So-min as Mudeok / Naksu / Jin Buyeon**

> The protagonist, Naksu is a skilled assassin and a mage who shifts her soul to a girl and loses all her powers. She believed she would retain her powers, but she had accidentally shifted into a body that she did not intend to. It is the body of a blind girl named Mu Deok, but Naksu can see with her eyes. It is unusual, but more unusual things happen in her life in no time. She gets sold to a brothel in Songrim, and Jang Uk catches her stealing his plaque. Jang Uk brought her home as his maid, but he had different intentions. 

**Yoo In-soo as Park Dang-gu / Summer**

>Nephew of Park Jin and the next leader of Songrim, Park Dang Gu is a meticulously stylish guy whose appearance is too modern for his era. He has blonde hair and wears flashy clothes and fancy earrings. He is a skilled mage but is rather relaxed and playful, in contrast to Seo Yul. He is a loyal friend who would rather lose a battle and humiliate himself than see his friend get punished. Dang Gu was the most youthful in his friend circle, and his friends did not expect him to be the first one to get married and with his first love, at that as he was secretive about his love life.

**Hwang Min-hyun as Seo Yul / Fall**

>The Seo family is a family of intellectuals, and Seo Yul is the eldest son of this generation of the Seo family. Yul is also a genius and has mastered many spells ahead of his peers. He is disciplined and strict. His serious attitude makes him look intimidating and competitive, but he has a softer nature and helps those in need all the time. He is the ideal person with power who believes it to be his responsibility to use his power for the welfare of others.

**Arin as Jin Cho-yeon / Spring**

![choe yeon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103475835/206911715-0a75c553-16b5-44fd-a060-b8f86fb034ed.jpg)
>The youngest daughter of Jinyowon, Jin Cho Yeon, is a powerful mage just like her mother. The Jin family practices matriarchy and is the only major family led by a woman. Jinyowon’s soldiers are also women. Cho Yeon has grown up with a strict mother and an absent father who has been searching for Cho Yeon’s older sister, Bu Yeon, for ten years

**Shin Seung-ho as the Crown Prince**

>The crown prince, Go Won, is the only child of the King and, naturally, the next King of Daeho. He is similar in age to Uk, Yul, and Dang Gu, but he didn’t have a friend until he met Jang Uk, who became his ‘frenemy’. The crown prince’s master is Jin Mu, who has been closely associated with the royal family, acting as their security.

**Yu Jun-sang as Uncle Park Jin**

![park jins](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103475835/206911983-fdd6a722-cd3b-47bf-ab32-464702a4f635.jpg)
>Park Jin is the leader of Songrim and holds more power than any other mage family in Daeho. Apart from being a leader, he is an extraordinary mage who mastered difficult spells at a young age. He is the closest friend of Jang Gang and knows every secret, including Jang Uk’s birth. Park Jin had always been strict with Jang Uk and strongly opposed opening his gate of energy because only he knew why Jang Gang closed it in the first place. 

**Jo Jae-yoon as Jin Mu**

![jin mus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103475835/206911982-bd79bc90-6a8b-4384-8579-d36732c9b54f.jpg)
>The embodiment of evil, Jin Mu is a vile mage who is an illegitimate child of Jinyowon. He was never accepted in Jinyowon, but Jang Gang took him in as his assistant. Jang Gang trusted Jin Mu, but he turned out to be greedy and became disastrous. He made soul ejectors and killed many innocent people. Jin Mu was trained by Jang Gang in magic, but more than that, he had an exceptional ability to manipulate people and use them for his benefit.
