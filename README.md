**CHARACTERS INFORMATION**

  **Jang Uk**
> He's only son of Jang Gang, the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan, Jang Uk, is one of the heirs of four major families. The heirs of four major families are called the “four seasons.” However, Jang Uk is different from the other three. His mother died after giving birth to him, and his father abandoned him. Jang Gang called Jang Uk an illegitimate child and cut off the energy flow that he was born with. Without the energy flow, Jang Uk was just a normal person and didn’t fit into the circle of mages. Yet, his friends Seo Yul and Park Dang Gu never let him feel like an outcast. Jang Uk often felt humiliated, but he was persistent in reopening his energy flow. He trained under every master in Daeho, but no one could open his energy flow because Jang Gang had told everyone not to.
